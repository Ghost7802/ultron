## 🌌 What is ULTRON?

**ULTRON** is an autonomous, privacy-preserving, local-first personal computer agent designed for developers, power users, and sci-fi enthusiasts. Rather than relying on cloud APIs or sending personal keystrokes and microphone streams over the internet, ULTRON runs **100% locally** on consumer hardware (Intel Core i5, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD) using optimized local small language models (`Qwen 2.5`), local Faster-Whisper transcription, and native Windows operating system hooks.

It fuses a cinematic **Tony Stark holographic HUD** with real developer tooling: dynamic multi-step autonomous planning, sandboxed process execution, native Windows UI Automation discovery, and a permanent 5-layer memory system.

## 🌟 Core System Capabilities

### 1. 🔮 Holographic 3D Particle Orb & Bare-Hand Control
- **Interactive Three.js Scene**: Dynamic particle cluster representing AI neural states: `idle`, `listening`, `thinking`, `executing`, `speaking`, `gesture`, and `error`.
- **MediaPipe Hand Tracking**: Control rotation, orbit, and zoom using webcam gestures directly through the browser or native desktop app with zero physical input.
- **Full-Duplex Barge-In Speech**: Speak at any moment to interrupt ULTRON's speech playback immediately.

### 2. ⚡ Zero-Latency Deterministic Intent Router (`lib/intentRouter.ts`)
- **0ms Immediate Subsystems**: Queries for system clock, calendar, orb camera resets, and live hardware diagnostics route directly to deterministic kernel rules with **0 ms model latency**.
- **Factual Guardrails & Anti-Hallucination**: Traps common trick questions (e.g., *"Who was US president in 1650?"*, *"Atomic number of Vibranium"*) and answers with factual certainty without touching the LLM.
- **Targeted Telemetry vs. Conceptual Disambiguation**: Diagnostic requests (*"Check CPU and RAM usage"*) route to real telemetry, while conceptual questions (*"Explain what RAM is"*) route to the local neural model.

### 3. 🧠 5-Layer Persistent Memory Architecture (`lib/ultronMemory.ts`)
ULTRON features a structured memory engine with five isolated layers:
- **Session Memory**: In-memory ring buffer of active conversational turns with fast recency weighting.
- **Project Memory**: Codebase architecture, decisions, file anchors, and build commands.
- **Personal Memory**: Permanent user preferences, communication style, identity, and verified facts.
- **Inbox / Candidate Memory**: Unverified facts and prospective patterns held for automated evaluation.
- **Vault Memory**: High-security configuration, protected system settings, and cryptographic confirmation tokens.
- **Safety First**: Atomic writes, automatic pre-migration backups, and cryptographic confirmation tokens required before memory wipes.

### 4. 🛠️ Real Computer Control & Sandboxed Execution (`lib/ultronTools.ts`)
ULTRON does not simulate actions — it performs verified operations on the local machine:
- **Process Lifecycle Tracking**: Launches and tracks real executables from an approved allowlist (`notepad`, `calculator`, `explorer`, `vscode`).
- **Developer Command Engine**: Runs safe commands (`git status`, `git diff`, `npm test`, `pytest`, `python tests/`) using child process `spawn` without shell interpolation.
- **Filesystem Primitives**: Safe path-bounded directory listing (`list_directory`), safe file moving (`move_file`), and atomic patch file editing with automatic backup (`patch_file`).
- **Cryptographic Security Gates**: Destructive operations (process termination, file deletion, memory reset) are strictly blocked until authorized with a single-use token.

### 5. 🤖 Bounded Dynamic ReAct Agent Execution Loop (`lib/ultronAgentEngine.ts`)
When asked to perform complex goals (*"ULTRON, test my project, identify failures, and fix them"*):
1. **Understand**: Parses goal and extracts verifiable success conditions.
2. **Plan & Reason**: Generates dynamic tool decisions step-by-step.
3. **Act**: Executes real primitives against the workspace.
4. **Observe & Self-Heal**: Analyzes tool outputs, logs, and compiler errors to formulate recovery actions.
5. **Verify & Report**: Validates exit codes and presents a structured report to the user HUD.
- **Safety Boundaries**: Maximum 5 iterations per request, 60s hard timeout, call deduplication, and strictly bounded observation buffers.

### 6. 🪟 Native Windows UI Automation & Discovery (`lib/ultronUIAutomation.ts`)
- **Desktop Window Discovery (`enumerate_windows`)**: Discovers all active top-level desktop windows, capturing HWND, PID, process name, window class, visibility, and bounds.
- **Accessibility Element Tree (`inspect_window_elements`)**: Connects to the user's interactive desktop (`Default` on `WinSta0`) to inspect buttons, panes, text fields, automation IDs, and keyboard focus states.
- **Read-Only Safety Guarantee**: Exclusively inspects properties without mouse clicks, keystrokes, or window state tampering.

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy Architecture

- **100% Offline & Local**: No microphone audio, video frames, keystrokes, or code snippets are ever transmitted to third-party cloud servers.
- **Path Sandboxing**: File operations are strictly confined within the active project workspace root and operating system temporary directory.
- **Cryptographic Gate**: Destructive actions (`close_application`, `delete_file`, `reset_memory`) generate an ephemeral single-use confirmation token valid for 120 seconds.
- **Read-Only UIA**: The Windows UI Automation bridge contains zero mouse-clicking, keystroke generation, or window modification primitives.
